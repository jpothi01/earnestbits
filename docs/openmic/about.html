                        <h3>What's this app for?</h3>
                        <p>OpenMic has two main functions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Record and organize video recordings of artistic performances</li>
                            <li>Alert performers when their alloted time is up</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Typically, the event organizer sets up an iPhone on a tripod in front of the stage. This way, the performers can easily see the warning light.</p>
